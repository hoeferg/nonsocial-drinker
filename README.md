# The nonsocial-drinker app
 _An Application for Nonsocial People_

---
## Overview

The nonsocial-drinker app is a tool for those of us who prefer to keep to ourselves in crowds and busy social situations.

When one finds it difficult to decide on a drink, come up with something to say, or are just too darn nice to bail on the party in mid stream.  This app will help by generating an alcoholic mixed drink selection based off of your alcohol preference, ie. wiskey, rum, or vodka.  Then the user can choose to generate a joke and an axcuse to leave as well.

Give it a try and may find that this app will take away the friction in those awkward social situations.  Cheers!
